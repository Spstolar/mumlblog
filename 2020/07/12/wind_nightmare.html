<p><strong>Issue</strong>: The widgets in Jupyter Notebook were not all displaying.</p>

<p><strong>Non-solution</strong>: Try re-do some installs in the virtualenv. While I am at it, let’s also try out pyenv.</p>

<p><strong>New Issue</strong>: Windows does not play well with pyenv. You can get pyenv to work, but then virtualenv is no longer set up on your global environment.</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution</strong>: Try to clone the pyenv-virtualenv repo into a new plugins directory of the pyenv root folder. This did not work, despite sinking about an hour into this whole mess.</p>

<p><strong>New Issue</strong>: It’s time to put Linux on my machine to try and escape some of these Windows nightmares. This is going to be a headache, but it seems like the pay off will be worth-while, given that the Fastbook also doesn’t play well with Windows. I have been frustrated with doing Python things on Windows before so I had Linux available already. I will note that it took be a while to remember I already had a Linux partition and in a cascading wave of failure, I forgot my linux password, so was not able to run a needed sudo command. But, I got lucky again (and this is a yikes security-wise) and it turns out you can easily reset the password for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>From here I followed <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv">Real Python’s primer on pyenv</a>. Setting this up was not bad and putting some lines in .bashrc virtualenv becomes much nicer to use. It allows you connect a particular environment to a folder. I created a virtualenv named <code class="highlighter-rouge">fab</code> (FastAI Book, short environment names are good when you’re used to activating an environment every time you want to work on something) by again <a href="https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/">following Real Python</a> and now it is automatically activated when I am in the fastbook directory. A quick <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install -r requirements.txt -v</code> got the environment running smoothly with the notebook for Chapter 1, and things that did not work 100% in Windows worked in my Linux boot nicely (at least after a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install graphviz</code>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>I could run the cells without having to change <code class="highlighter-rouge">num_workers</code> to 0.</li>
  <li>My GPU was visible to Torch (<code class="highlighter-rouge">torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)</code> returned the name of my GPU).</li>
  <li>The text example, which did not work at all on Windows, ran.</li>
  <li>And, the whole reason I started this endeavor: when I created the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileUploader</code> widget, it appeared in the notebook.</li>
</ul>
